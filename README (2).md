# TRAFFIC PREDICTION
This project focuses on predicting traffic patterns using machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic management and improve commuting efficiency. By analyzing historical traffic data, weather conditions, and time of day, the model forecasts traffic volume and congestion levels at different locations and times. The goal is to provide real-time insights for better route planning, minimizing traffic jams, and reducing travel time. The trained model provides predictions on future traffic conditions, helping commuters and traffic authorities plan routes effectively.
The project uses traffic data, including vehicle counts, timestamps, weather data, and location-specific features. The data is cleaned and processed to ensure its suitability for model training. Logistic Regression is employed to classify traffic conditions into three categories: Heavy Traffic,Low Traffic and Normal Traffic . The model is trained using features such as time, weather conditions, and historical traffic data.
 The Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated using metrics like Accuracy.Achieved an Accuracy Rate of 73.49%.

Project Goals:
To predict traffic congestion (heavy , low or normal) based on historical and real-time factors.
To implement a practical machine learning approach (Logistic Regression) for a binary classification task in traffic management.
To assist in optimizing routes and improving traffic flow in urban environments.

This project is ideal for understanding the application of Logistic Regression in predicting binary outcomes and provides valuable insights into real-time traffic management.
